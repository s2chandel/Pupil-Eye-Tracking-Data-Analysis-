# Pupil-Eye-Tracking-Data-Analysis-


	Analysis on pupil eye position, data was collected using an eye tracking device connected to a computer.
•	Pupil labs headset was used which is head mounted device that contains two cameras.

•	The data collected through the device is explored using plots and further pre-processing and filtering is done by applying moving average. 

•	An experiment with four participants was performed by collecting the data using the device under both stationary and dynamic setup. Further, data was visualized and deviation for both the setups was calculated.

•	This study was helpful in understanding the deviation caused due to optical illusion and further study is being made to leverage this knowledge in the enhancement of VR experience.
